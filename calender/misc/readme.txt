INSTALLATION

1) Read the terms and conditions set forth in the End User License Agreement (EULA) contained in the file "misc\EULA.txt".  If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of the EULA, do not install this software.

2) Edit the "setup.inc.php" file to include your website information, color choices and optional title image.  Descriptions are provided for appropriate fields.  All color values must be in hexadecimal format without the # symbol.

3) Edit the "config.inc.php" file to include the information used to attach to your MySQL database.  If the MySQL database that will be used to hold the calendar tables does not exist you must create it manually.  See the MySQL website for further help with creating databases or contact your service provider.

4) Copy all files in the calendar, administration and creation file lists to a directory on your website.  Be certain to place the administration and creation files in a subdirectory off of the calendar directory.

5) Open your web browser to point to "create.php" on your website.  Enter the username and password (if applicable) for the administrative user.  This file should create all the tables needed in your MySQL database for the calendar application.  This administrative user can be removed once a new user is created.

6) Delete the calendar creation files from your website.  These file is only needed for the initial table creation.


NOTE

Version 2.1.4 of the Proverbs Web Calendar is not compatible with calendar database tables prior to version 2.0.

                   two settings "24" and "12".  Setting the variable to "12" will force display of time
                   on the schedule in a 12 hour AM/PM format.  Setting the variable to "24" or any other
                   setting will display the schedule in the standard 24 hour format.
                   2) Added variable $start_day in the "layoung.inc.php" file.  This variable is used

                   to "auto" will force display of the servers time zone on the schedule page.  All
                   other settings will display the variable's text; i.e. $time_zone = 'EST' will
                   display 'EST' after each hour block regardless of the servers time zone.
                   2) Added javascript onClick event to the radio buttons when selecting an entry
